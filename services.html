                            <div>We think that brand identity is something more than merely a logo, font set and a company�s collateral guidelines. Brand identity is the whole image � a set of visual and psychological associations that combine in consumers� minds. We start with detailed research and analyze the feelings and emotions which the brand should evoke in customers. This is the fundamental information we use as a foundation in the process of a new brand creation. The result of our work is a set of all necessary elements and guidelines for their correct usage - a brand book with usage rules, brand promotion strategy for different channels, and the necessary technical recommendations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We help our clients to communicate a brand identity to customers which exactly matches the desired concept needed to achieve the company�s goal. In the future we can also adapt the brand for newly-emerging needs � for example, to conduct a particular promotional campaign or design the interior of the company office to match the brand identity. In addition to developing a brand from scratch we can assist in evolving an existing brand. We can audit branding to improve elements to match a company�s changing strategy and developing market, provide assistance in rebranding projects or in developing additional products, design cobranding for new partnership, and help develop more effective promotion strategies for an existing brand.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>

                        <div class="s-description__text-block">
                            <div>There are many different types of animation on the web � from interfaces and transition elements to fully interactive animated scenes.</div><div><br></div><div>Quality interface animation is subtle � an enduser intuitively understands it as a logical compliment of an online interface. By contrast, bad interface animation is noticeable, and it irritates everybody. So, the main focus while creating animated interfaces is to ensure that it enhances an experience rather than detracts from enjoyment and usability. Sometimes, it would be better to leave out animation rather than to risk ruining user interfaces. When creating interface animations, we use only the fastest technologies in rendering, which can sometimes limit options.</div><div><br></div><div>When working with large, interactive scenes we use a completely different approach. Since the goal is typically to impress the users, our engineers and designers use all available technical solutions, and we closely monitor the results to create something both fast and impressive. We develop the plot of the scene, formulate the necessary motion, work out the details, and then combine it all within the final code.</div><div>One common characteristic of all animation is the intensity of challenge: converting a designer�s visual concept into working code is complex and at times, tedious. The designers and developers work closely together to generate sequences that have a good combination of speed, smoothness of motion, and provide the best experience.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We�ve discovered a non-obvious solution for this challenge � using the universal language of mathematics. Our designer�s actions are translated into mathematic language using special tools, and then the developer can implement the resultant mathematic functions in the final code. This solution requires some extensive training for our designers and developers, but it makes it possible to achieve results much more rapidly.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, we are not limited to producing animations from start to finish. If a client has a concept already developed some by another designer, our developers are experienced enough to make an animation based on that prior work.</div>

                        <div class="s-description__text-block">
                            <div>Developing special promo websites (sometimes also called �microsites�) is one of the most popular options in web marketing. And, it is not surprising. Very often, an event or special release necessitates the creation of a modern, light website. The goal of such a website is to be entertaining, memorable and highly informative. For our experts this sort of project provides a great opportunity to develop a site in accordance with the latest trends, applying the newest and most impressive technologies which we work to remain familiar with. Integration with social networks and elaboration of technical basis for the maximum productive effect of social exchange is very important for most promo sites. We don�t forget about that. And we know: We must thoroughly understand the information to qualitatively present it. That is why we begin our work on promo sites with a careful study of the theme and topic. And, naturally, the timeframe for developing such sites is usually critical. Fortunately, the scale of most promo sites is small, and so a new site can be developed very fast. We work hard and rapidly at all stages.</div><div><br></div><div>We categorize sites that are similar in format (such as business card sites, personal blogs etc.) to the as promo sites. Our approach to creating such sites is virtually the same, but we take into account the specific requirements dictated by the type.&nbsp;</div>

                        <div class="s-description__text-block">
                            <div>There are many devices in the world for accessing the internet. It is not only computers and notebooks anymore. Different smartphones, tablets, and TV access devices are becoming more and more popular. Lately, the percent of mobile traffic has been greatly increasing. In order to address the multi-device trend, it is necessary to take into account multiple website display characteristics: different resolutions, different screen sizes. User-flow can become a significant problem in mobile interfaces � if the site is too inconvenient to use on mobile devices, a large percentage of the audience may be lost, and, consequently, profits may be lost.</div><div><br></div><div>Work on developing an adaptive website begins with thinking through the design and layout while taking into account the functionality of specific devices. Our designers place graphic user-interface (�GUI�) elements so that if the different component blocks minimize or move, the main visual concepts and essence of the site won�t be lost. The resulting site is still easy to use and visually attractive.</div><div><br></div><div>It is very important to implement an adaptive layout � to make the site dynamic and user-friendly. This can be done in a few different ways:</div><ul><li>The so-called �rubber� layout � the main panels can be stretched or compressed depending on the width of the device screen;<br></li><li><span>Transfer sidebars � this is recommended for multicolumn websites for switching layouts when browsing from different devices to maximize legibility, but it�s also very labor-intensive;&nbsp;</span></li><li>Elementary scaling � this option may be sufficient for simple sites.</li></ul>
Naturally, these variations are not universal solutions. When developing adaptive sites for our clients, we focus on the best solution to address the users� tasks for which each site resource was originally designed to fulfill. Our approach is individualized for every distinct situation.&nbsp;

                            <div>Every website and web resource is provided for a specific purpose. As a general rule, a site is a business tool, so in addition to its design and development it is necessary to take complex promotional measures to attract visitors in order to convert them into subscribers, achieve sales, or attract them for other conversion activities.</div><div><br></div><div>For the introduction of completely new sites, offer to help you through first researching the online marketplace and we�ll perform competitive analysis in order to develop a business model � this research will be used to inform us as to how to the website will need to be designed and promoted. We help our clients to evolve a plan aimed towards achieving their business goals, and we help bring it to life at each step � from site development to increasing its conversions and profitability over time.</div><div><br></div><div>For already-existing sites we are always ready to perform an audit in order to detect search optimization weaknesses, and to evaluate traffic and conversion sources. As a result of the audit, we will make a plan to improve the site�s position in search results, and thereby attract more visitors and sales.</div><br>
Generally, our optimization service may be divided into 2 categories:<div><ul><li>Internal optimization: Insuring that the technical details of the website�s code is in accordance with the search engines� recommendations, performing good content optimization, and installation of any necessary tools or other elements.<br></li><li>External optimization: obtaining listings for the site in online catalogues, setting up social profiles, getting links back to the site into various resources in the form of comments, recommendations, chats and so on.<br></li></ul><div>During the process of working on the site, we constantly focus on the desired results, and aim all tools and activities towards one thing only � the achievement of your business goals.

                            <div>A quarter of the world�s population uses smartphones. The quantity of mobile applications is more than a million and a half � a giant number. It is a huge market, which has many aspects. You can see some of them below.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Different platforms � iOS, Android, Windows Phone: For a developer it means writing code in three programming languages. Or one can use cross-platform options, which are not so flexible in capabilities. We make a very deliberate decision about what technology should be used for every specific situation.</div><div><br></div><div>Different platforms have different UI standards. Android users are used to having a menu in top left corner. In the same location on iPhones, users can find a context-sensitive �back� button. Our designers know all of these points and will provide the ideal interface that�s most familiar to users.</div><div><br></div><div>Official app stores further deepen fragmentation. Every store places its requirements on applications and developers. We take into consideration all these nuances and provide full support of applications until the application is approved by the store and goes on sale. If desired, we also provide postproduction support, issue new versions, and so on.</div><div><br></div><div>Many applications need access to data from the cloud. In order to support both web and mobile applications simultaneously, we make the backend data source to be universal. This offers an advantage in terms of the speed of development and flexibility of functional options.</div>

We can focus on these advantages.</div><div><br></div><div>Our interface designers find user-friendly solutions, intuitive controls, hotkeys, and gestures. Mouse, keyboard, trackpad, touchscreen � we keep in mind all options for interactions with applications. Our developers focus on the final goal � users must get pleasure from using the interface.</div><div><br></div><div>Our developers know many operating system capabilities, so they can execute a functional application with a high level of quality.

                            <div>The prospect of producing any device raises many questions for business owners, especially in cases where it is one�s first experience in the production sphere. The process of creating any product ranging from simple ballpoint pens to high-tech gadgets such as modern smartphones includes many stages. Content development takes into account all the technical features involved in production: the creation of a model housing; the selection of the right materials; prototyping for testing; selecting the desired factory; preparation of all necessary digital files for production; quality control organization and many other things up to the design of the final packaging. All these stages are closely connected, so a mistake at any stage could result in the necessity to redo a major part of the project. That is why understanding of the production stages is vital for avoiding many potentially expensive problems.</div><div><br></div><div>We have sufficient experience in industrial design and knowledge of the necessary details.&nbsp;</div><div>We are ready to provide the product from initial sketches all the way up to manufacturing the parts and final packaging. We have the necessary technical background for prototyping (3D printers, laser cutters, industrial printers etc.), so we can provide your device prototypes quickly and inexpensively. We enjoy industrial design projects because they involve mathematics (NURBS, strength of materials etc.), and math is our passion.&nbsp;</div><div>We like challenges too, by the way.
